            <p>Choosing to adopt a cat or kitten is an exciting time. However, there are many things to consider before
                adopting a pet to help ensure you’re able to properly provide the right care and attention to your cat
                or
                kitten.</p>
            <img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/profile.ppets/1828/3912712285cb534b9885467.75206526-profile-1828.jpeg"

            <h2>The adoption process</h2>
            <p>Matching the right people to the right cat is important to us at <span class="rspca">RSPCA</span>, that's
                why we have an adoption
                process. Take your time to think about what type of cat you are after, and what type of cat is right for
                you
                and your
                family.</p>
            <p>Owning a cat is a great experience as they are excellent companions. However, although cats are often
                independent and seem quite self-sufficient, it is important to remember that they do require lots of
                care
                and affection from their people. Before you adopt a cat please ensure that you have thought carefully
                about
                the responsibility of cat ownership.</p>
            <p>Please visit the <span class="rspca">RSPCA</span> to see all of the cats and kittens that we have
                available for adoption. All adult cats
                receive a behaviour assessment, and our staff will be able to offer advice on the particular cat that
                you
                have
                chosen. It is important to note any recommendations that staff make in regard to a particular cats'
                suitability to
                different home environments, such as those with small children and/or other resident cats. Our cats have
                been colour coded
                using our “Find Your Feline Friend” system to give you an indication of the family type that will suit
                them
                best.
                Above all else, our interest is in the welfare of the cat and making sure that they find a 'forever
                home'.</p>
            <p>Each shelter will require an adoption application form to be filled out, and an additional 24-hour
                cooling
                off period may be required to give you the opportunity to ensure you have made the right decision. After
                this cooling
                off period, an interview can be arranged with an adoption officer to ensure that the best possible match
                has
                been
                made.</p>

            <h2>Selecting a cat or kitten</h2>
            <p>When it comes to selecting a cat or kitten, take your time to think about what type of cat you are after,
                and what type of pet is right for you and your family.</p>
            <p>An <span class="rspca">RSPCA</span> shelter is a fantastic place to start your search. You will find
                animals
                available for adoption
                who are medically and behaviourally sound; most are perfectly healthy and sociable, and are simply
                waiting for a
                new home and a loving family. Please think about your next family member coming from the <span

            <h2>Caring for your cat or kitten</h2>
            <p>Bringing a new cat or kitten home is a wonderful, exciting experience. It is very important that you take
                the time to help your new family member feel safe and comfortable in their new surroundings, so the
                whole
                family can enjoy this new relationship.</p>
            <p>Although cats are often independent and seem quite self-sufficient, it is important to remember that they
                do require lots of care and affection from their people.</p>
            <p>The <span class="rspca">RSPCA</span> recommends that owned cats should be kept safe and happy at home,
                ideally all of the time to
                protect them from the dangers of roaming. Cats should confined at a minimum from dusk to dawn. This
                helps to
                reduce the risk of accidents and fights and provide some protection to wildlife.</p>
